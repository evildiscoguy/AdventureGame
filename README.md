# AdventureGame
A simple adventure game written in Python

This was written for me to help put my Python learnings into practise. It's far from finished but I hope to keep adding new things here and there. For example, at the moment you might realise the inventory is pointless. Hopefully that'll change soon. Plus there's not much of an ending either.
